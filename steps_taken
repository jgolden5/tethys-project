Purpose: create a recreateable tethys environment
I - create and activate tethys environment
  1 - installed miniconda with brew = 'brew install miniconda'
  2 - created new venv = 'conda create -n tethys'
  3 - source entire path for activate (must be overwritten?) = 'source /usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/activate'
  4 - initialized conda with bash = 'conda init bash'
  5 - activated tethys venv = 'conda activate tethys'
II - Data Prep
  1 - download sample nextGen data (note, this time I'm going to put map_layout_tutorial inside workspaces dir, app_workspace dir inside map_layout_tutorial/, and then the contents of sample_nextgen_data.zip inside app_workspace/. I also unzipped the file as follows - 'unzip sample_nextgen_data.zip -d sample_nextgen_data'. This was in order to have the directory "sample_nextgen_data" as the example states. {a note from Jonathan in the future--workspaces/map_layout_tutorial/app_workspace, as the tutorial states, does NOT work. What DOES work is map_layout_tutorial/workspaces/app_workspace, so swap workspaces and map_layout_tutorial directories from what the tutorial says.}
  2 - explore the data (again). This time, see if I can understand the nexus file a little more, and how the data differs from the catchments.
  3 - reproject the spatial data. (This involves the copy/pasting of reproject_environment.yml and reproject.py, the creation of another conda env based on reproject_environment.yml, actually ENTERING said reproject env, and then running reproject.py on the nexus and catchments geojson files)
III - Add Spatial Data to Map Layout
  1 - override compose_layers function of MapLayout in ~/tethys/tethysdev/tethysapp-map_layout_tutorial/tethysapp/workspaces/map_layout_tutorial/controllers.py
  2 - adjust the map's default zoom and extent to automatically zoom on the relevant data
    useful tip for understanding default_map_extent variable: In the chrome debugger console, type - "ol.proj.transformExtent(TETHYS_MAP_VIEW.getMap().getView().calculateExtent(TETHYS_MAP_VIEW.getMap().getSize()), 'EPSG:3857', 'EPSG:4326')"
  3 - I'm getting a 404 error for http://localhost:8000/apps/map-layout-tutorial/, so I'm assuming the position of my workspace/map_layout_tutorial/app_workspace was wrong, and I will swap workspace and map_layout_tutorial directories just to see if that works. (Note, that was indeed the issue, AND, I'm finally seeing nexus data already!!)
  4 - replace controllers.py with more code as described in the "3. Adjust the layer styles" section
  5 - just to show that I somewhat know what's going on, I'm going to change the outer nexus colors from red to green, and the outline color for the catchments from blue to yellow.
IV - Configure Map Layout Data Plotting
  1 - configure NextGen data plotting by replacing controllers.py with additional code that includes new import (pandas), new constant (app_workspace), 2 new properties set to true in MapLayoutTutorialMap class (show_properties_popup, plot_slide_sheet), get_plot_for_layer_feature function 
  2 - to dive deeper into what the code does, refer to the explanation near the end of the following link = https://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/latest/tutorials/map_layout/configure_data_plotting.html
V - (AZ branch) set up scaffolding and basic map (without data) in my own tethys app = https://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/latest/tutorials/key_concepts/new_app_project.html
  1 - go to ~/tethys/tethysdev, and run 'mkdir tethysapp-az_map', then 'cd tethysapp-az_map'
  2 - scaffold and install app via command line = https://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/latest/recipes/scaffold_an_app_via_command_line.html#scaffold-an-app-via-command-line
  3 - change icon logo (cactus.jpeg) and colors (deserty - #FEDCBA)
  4 - made my own basic version of the "Beginner Concepts" tutorial version of controllers.py = https://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/latest/tutorials/key_concepts/beginner.html
  5 - add a template extending base.html '~/tethys/tethysdev/tethysapp-az_map/tethysapp/az_map/templates/az_map/add_data.html' (based on the add_dam.html example), and a new controller in controllers.py
  6 - modify add_data.html by adding Add and Cancel buttons, and add controller
  7 - add a link to this new page in .../templates/az_map/base.html (changed original plus icon to plus database icon)
  8 - add customized navigation tab for base.html
  9 - highlight 
VI - add data to my web app (for this, I will give the intermediate tutorial a try, as it seems to touch on data input, which is really the only problem I have left to understand, I think) = https://docs.tethysplatform.org/en/latest/tutorials/key_concepts/intermediate.html#spatial-input-with-forms
  1 - add a form for add_data in add_data.html and controllers.py (starting to look powerful and interesting)
  2 - add form submission handling code to controllers.py
  3 - add file az_map/model.py with add_data function, and modify add_data function inside controllers.py for data persistence (check workspaces/app_workspace/data to see the JSON files being written)
  4 - completed "Develop Table View Page" step = add get_all_data function to model.py; add new template called .../templates/az_map/list_data.html with data_table; create new controller function in controllers.py called list_data (don't forget the imports too); and add header button to .../templates/az_map/base.html
  5 - completed "Spatial Input with Forms" step - 1) add location_input gizmo to .../templates/az_map/add_data.html; 2) add definition of location_input gizmo and validation code to the add_data controller in controllers.py; 3) modify the add_new_data method to store spatial data (in model.py); 4) navigate to workspaces/az_map/data and delete all JSON files now that the model has changed so the files will be consistent; 5) create several new entries using the updated add_data form; 6) check that these data points exist as expected, both in the tethys portal and on my local filesystem in workspaces/az_map/app_workspace/data. (make sure to replace every occurrance of 'dam' with 'data')
  6 - fix the issue where date_built automatically appends today's date to it = attempt a) change initial value in controllers.py on line 111 from date_built to ''; (this worked)
  7 - render spatial data on the map - big additions to code, but only in controllers.py (beware the silly date_built bug, but also keep in mind I will change this soon)
VII - get the scaffolding up for my own layout (az_irrigation -> map_layout_tutorial + .geojson) [general data hub for future reference] = https://azgeo-open-data-agic.hub.arcgis.com/
  1 - initial data download and prep, but with the .geojson data downloaded from this link = https://azgeo-open-data-agic.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd15ab8c811a49e8ac1b8a7ddcb64101_0/explore
  2 - reproject data to be accepted at geojsonlint.com = https://geojsonlint.com/
  3 - rename az_map to az_irrigation via rescaffolding (this can only be done by adding a new project with tethys scaffold az_irrigation, and copying over controllers.py, urls.py, templates, static files, services, models, workspaces, and custom scripts). I am also re-doing the very first step (I), but uninstalling and reinstalling miniconda due to issues getting my tethys app running. (for my future reference, the reason this step took so long to get my tethys command working after uninstallation was that I needed to install tethys with 'pip install tethysplatform' after entering tethys environment with 'conda activate tethys')
  4 - remove az_irrigation/az_map altogether (but save the .geojson file) and just build upon the map_layout_tutorial app (note that 'tethys manage tethys_app_uninstall az_map' was the way to officially uninstall the az_map-related code that was behind the scenes)
VIII - add a layer called irrigation to map_layout_tutorial, and make it point to the .geojson data points
  1 - add clickable irrigation layer which can be accessed from the layers menu (currently shows nothing)
  2 - copy nexus layer logic to irrigation layer to let the data points display in a similar fashion (hopefully)
  3 - grab a .csv for the az 1960s irrigation data, add it to .../app_workspace/outputs/, and implement it in the get_plot_for_layer_feature function (inside controllers.py)
  4 - went part-way through trying to get irrigation data working, but I plan to switch to ADOT traffic data due to mappable coordinates
IX - get data from ADOT instead and make it JUST that data on my map. This will be good enough for now because a) it's got a map; b) it's got plots (and coordinates); c) it's data I'm interested in; d) this is taking longer than I thought, haha
  1 - migrated data from irrigation geojson and csv to ADOT data for each
  2 - doing a surgical git operation to remove the huge files from my history
  3 - side quest = pull the tethys-project onto my user in digitalOcean server (using git) [success!]
  4 - take a lookie into the logic needed to extract data points from ADOT csv & geojson files
